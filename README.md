# Schelling Works

This is my project about Schelling’s segregation model.  
It shows how people’s small preferences can lead to bigger patterns, like segregation.

## What it does

I made a simple simulation in this notebook (`Schelling_works.ipynb`).  
You can run it step by step to see how agents move around on a grid to find neighbors they like, and how that changes the whole grid over time.
